Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, we have layed out the framework for the project. This entailes constructing a mock template of the dichotomous key, which is organized in a branching structure. To do this, we have put in reasearch on which characteristics distinguish each organism classification. Along with this, we have done basic reasearch on how to incorporate renPy in our project.  

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

So far, we have yet to code much of the project. However, it was important for us to get a set template for the key before deciding how we want to tackle the project. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

At the start of the project, we had some trouble figuring out how to start the dichotomous key (which characteristics should be the distinguishing factors).
